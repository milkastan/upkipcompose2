*Figure 85: Upkip Administration - Downtime of machine with assigned calendars*

**Downtime period types** are colored with different colors and could be: **unplanned, untagged and OK.** 

For periods **not included in the shift calendar** machine have status **Unplanned.**

- **Unplanned (grey)**  - The time when the machine was not planned to produce, according to the shift calendar. Unplanned time is **any time out of the shift or during breaks**.

For period **planned in the shift calendar** machine could have statuses – **OK or Untagged.**

- **Untagged (yellow)** - A period that is subject to tagging with a downtime reason by the system operator who is the responsible to provide explanation up the chain on the reason why the machine has not been producing in a period when it has been planned to. Low level of production time would mean high level of downtime, which could be explained by analyzing the top downtime reasons. The downtime tagging reasons are grouped in 4 groups: Man, Machine, Method and Material. 
- **OK** (green) - A period that is not considered as downtime and typically originates from the following machine statuses: Active, Machine offline, Machine online, System offline, System online.
