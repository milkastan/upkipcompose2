## About Documentation

The Upkip documentation website provides the documentation for **Upkip Administration** module functionalities.

Documentation version is **28 May, 2021**.

    
Upkip documentation website is developed by Interconsult Bulgaria LTD using **Hugo** static website generator and the ‘c8ydocs’ theme.


The actual content of the documentation is stored in source files in Markdown format. These Markdown files are located in the folder /content. 

You will find a subfolder for every main menu topic here, which again contains markdown files.

All images are supported in *.png files. 

Search functionality is implemented for searching between all documentation topics.
