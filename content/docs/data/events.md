**Purpose**: Different events could be created in the Upkip Administration. They are built with a specifically designed expression language that supports some limited amount of operations and functions. Event triggers when defined expression in it returns true. Events trigger the warnings and notifications. 

When Tags of type Int have defined MIN/MAX values, events are created automatically if tag value is outside of the defined region.
### **Create Events manually**
Precondition: User with role Administrator is logged in Upkip Administration. Select menu **Events**.
